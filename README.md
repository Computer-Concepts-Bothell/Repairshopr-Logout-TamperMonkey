# Repairshopr-Logout-TamperMonkey
Repairshopr Logout TamperMonkey

Having Problems at work with people not signing out of repairshopr on the front counter. 
Made a TamperMonkey script to auto log out the user after 10 minutes. 
If you use the script you can change the var to whatever you need.

### Versions
